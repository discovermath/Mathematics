Hello, I am a middle schooler. I love to think, especially in the areas of math and physics. I keep thinking about relationships between different mathematical constructs and I make my own "theorems". So whenever a possibility of a relation clicks to me, I try to formulate and write a proof for it. In this GitHub Repo, I keep uploading for my own sake.

I do not know if one or more of these are already well known. If you are aware of some source where these properties are described, please let me know the name/source of the theorem.

Also, if you find any errors in my proofs, please report back to me. It will improve my proofing skills.

I also have a physics repository like this which you can find here: github.com/sakshamsethi123/Physics.
